 - 2oz whiskey
 - 4oz soda water
 - lemon twist

 Directions: Fill a highball glass with ice cubes, then add the whiskey. Top with soda water, stir gently, and garnish with the lemon twist.

## Highball

The first drink is one of the simplest cocktails possible - the highball. For this first entry, I chose to make the classic whiskey highball, using a Japanese whiskey (Kaiyo 7 year), Topo Chico, ice, and a lemon twist, built in a highball glass. The whiskey highball is a simple but elegant drink that has far more nuance than the basic ingredients and elementary construction would suggest. The choice of whiskey and soda water are very important - I would recommend against using a cheap whiskey for this drink, and the choice of soda water is also very important, as the mineral content could conflict with the whiskey.

This drink is an excellent cocktail for beginners or veterans of the cocktail world. I have met many bartenders who primarily drink whiskey highballs, despite having the expertise to make pretty much any drink they could desire. Why? I think it's because this drink does a *fantastic* job of highlighting the qualities of the whiskey in a way that drinking it neat or on the rocks simply cannot match. The effervescence of the soda water and the dilution reveals flavors that are not immediately apparent when confronted with the straight liquor. The additional hydration from the soda water also makes it easy to drink several of these in a session.

There is much that could be said about building a highball - the quality of the ice, perfecting the lemon twist (mine needs work), the choices for whiskey and soda water, and stirring the drink just so, in a way that carbonation is preserved but the whiskey is integrated into the drink, are all critical to making the perfect highball. However, I think this cocktail is amazing even if you use a cheap whiskey, soda water, bad ice, and skip the twist.

According to lore, there are dedicated highball bars in Japan where every part of building this drink is elevated to an art form, from stacking the ice cubes in the glass, to pouring the whiskey in just such a way, to the stir and presentation. I have not experienced this myself, but hope to one day. But I think this is the key joy of cocktails - even for the simplest possible drink, there's always some way to make it better and improve technique that results in a better experience, but at the same time putting the drink together with whatever is available in a plastic cup is going to result in something pretty good. My recommendation for something this simple is to try to use good whiskey, good soda water, and good ice, but if you don't have them available, you can still drink a refreshing and delicious cocktail.

## Variants

If I really wanted to, I could probably fill out 100 cocktails entirely with variants on the highball. A short but non-comprehensive list includes: whiskey coke, rum & coke, screwdriver (vodka & orange juice), gin & tonic, gin & soda, vodka tonic, vodka soda, greyhouse (vodka & grapefruit juice), Campari & soda, and the alternative whiskey highball made with ginger ale instead of soda water. Any two ingredient cocktail that consists of a spirit and a mixer is effectively a highball! This is probably the most commonly ordered cocktail in the world, in one of these many variants.
