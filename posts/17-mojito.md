## Mojito

The mojito is pretty similar to the <a href="/posts/14-collins/">Collins</a>, but with rum and the addition of mint. It's a refreshing highball, and the mint is a lovely addition that works really well with lime and rum. The bouquet adds some mint on the nose while you drink. Fantastic summer drink.

### Ingredients

Mojitos traditionally call for a white rum. Fresh lime juice and mint will improve the experience.

### History

The mojito was probably invented in Cuba by someone. Maybe Sir Francis Drake, but probably not.

### Preparation Notes

Mojitos don't always call for crushed ice, I think it's a nice touch though. Muddling the mint should be done very gently,

Cheers!
