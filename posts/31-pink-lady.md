## Pink Lady

This was my first time making this drink, and honestly I am not a big fan. The grenadine and gin is just a little too thin and unbalanced, even though the drink is smooth. There's another drink called the Clover Club which adds lemon juice to this, and I believe that will be an improvement.

This drink looks nice, and it is very smooth, there's a lot here that's working, I just don't love the overall flavor.

### Ingredients

Grenadine is a pomegranite syrup. I think it can be a great ingredient, but I don't think it's used well here as the only sweetener and flavor modifier in the drink.

### Preparation Notes

There may be a sweet spot level of grenadine that makes this drink work well. I may make additional attempts and update this space with any findings.

Cheers!
