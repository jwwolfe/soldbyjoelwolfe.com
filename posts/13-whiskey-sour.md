## Whiskey Sour

The whiskey sour is a close cousin of the daiquiri, swapping lime for lemon and rum for whiskey. The addition of egg white makes this an entirely different drink. Egg white as a cocktail ingredient does not work primarily for flavor, but for texture. A whiskey sour without egg white tastes fine, but the version made with egg white is a sensory wonderland.

### Ingredients

For this whiskey sour I used Savage and Cooke's The Burning Chair bourbon. Fresh lemon juice, of course for the sour part. The simple syrup could be adjusted up or down depending on sweetness preferences, but I like using a smaller proportion here to highlight the sour and whiskey more. For the egg white, you can separate out a yolk, or buy a carton of pasteurized egg whites if you want to avoid salmonella risk.

### History

This drink is very old and its history is shrouded in legend.

### Preparation Notes

On first glance this is a straightforward sour, but the addition of egg white requires special preparation. If you just put the ingredients in a shaker with ice, the egg does not froth correctly, which is the entire point of using eggs in cocktails! Instead, we do what's called a *dry shake* - shaking without ice. This needs to be a vigorous shake for at least 30 seconds, and it's a very important preparation step, because the execution here determines the texture and frothiness of the final drink. After this shake, add ice and shake only until cold, not as long as a usual shake with ice - the ingredients should all be fully incorporated from the first shake.

Cheers!
