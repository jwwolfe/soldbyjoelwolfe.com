## Colorado Bulldog

This is pretty similar to a White Russian, but the addition of cola works surprisingly well here.

### Ingredients

I used the exact same ingredients for this as I did for the White Russian - Tito's, homemade coffee liqueur, and whole milk, and used Coca-Cola to top.

### Preparation Notes

Pour the cola slowly to prevent curdling the milk.

Cheers!
