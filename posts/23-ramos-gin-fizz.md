 - Recipe
 - 2oz gin
 - .5oz lemon juice
 - .5oz lime juice

 - 2-3 drops orange blossom water
 - egg white
 - soda water
 - Directions: Add all ingredients to a shaker, and dry shake vigorously without ice for at least 30 seconds. Add ice to shaker and shake again.

## Ramos Gin Fizz

The Ramos Gin Fizz lives at the pinnacle of gin fizzes, of which there are many. This drink is inspired, using both lemon and lime juice, which is unusual in sours but delicious here. It also combines the egg white, cream, and soda water to produce a smooth texture that isn't replicated in many other drinks. The orange blossom water adds a floral complexity that elevates the entire experience to another level. This cocktail slaps.

### Ingredients

I used Plymouth Gin, but this drink could stand up to many gins. Orange blossom water is a somewhat uncommon cocktail ingredient, it's very strong and a little bit goes a long way. As always, use freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice. I used whole milk, various milk substitutes would work here, I think.

### Preparation Notes

When made properly, this drink has a pretty amazing frothy head. The key is shaking it really hard for a really long time on the first dry shake. This drink is pretty labor intensive, but the result is worth it.

Cheers!
