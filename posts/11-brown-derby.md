## Brown Derby

This is my first time making this drink. I modified the recipe above because when I made it, I used 1oz of honey syrup, and it is just too sweet. Which means today's post is going to partially be about what to do when you screw up making a cocktail.

In this case, the fix is pretty easy - I used too much sweetener, so to balance the drink I need more of the other ingredients. A start here would be returning the cocktail to the shaker (if I had been smarter I would have tasted before I poured, but I was not, so here we are), adding 1oz bourbon and .5oz grapefruit juice, shaking briefly to incorporate and chill the new ingredients, and retasting. If that is still too sweet, I can repeat, or modify the amounts added to dial in the correct flavor profile.

But this is a simple 3 ingredient cocktail, that's not too hard to fix up. What if you try something new and it just doesn't taste good? I don't have a tried and true answer to this question - it really depends on what the flavor profile you've created, and what you're looking to create, and being able to identify holes  in the overall balance and profile of the drink. Sometimes it's citrus, sometimes the drink needs some sweetener, sometimes the flavors clash too much and need something to bind them together (bitters can be a good option here, but again, depends on circumstances). So while I can't give ironclad rules, I can give some basic principles that have served me well.

First, taste frequently. I keep sipper straws on hand to sample drinks that I make to ensure they come out as I expect. Not just for making cocktails: make sure to taste any new ingredient you get for your bar on its own before mixing it into a drink. Not everything is going to be amazing on its own, but knowing the flavor profiles of all your ingredients separately helps to understand how they mix together.

Second, only make one change at a time. It might seem like a great idea to add mint, coffee liqueur, and blueberries to the drink you're making, and it might even be a good idea. Don't do all three at once. Try the first logical step, taste. Try the next, taste.

Third, don't be afraid of messing it up. Worst case, you've made something undrinkable and learned a lesson, at the cost of your ingredients (corollary: don't experiment with ingredients you aren't willing to lose). But experimenting is how new cocktails get made.

As for the Brown Derby itself, I don't have any tips on making this cocktail - I messed it up! It's interesting and I think I like it, the bourbon and grapefruit seemed strange but the honey makes it work, so long as you don't use too much.

Cheers!
