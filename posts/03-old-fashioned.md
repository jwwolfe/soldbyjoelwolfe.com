## Old Fashioned

The old fashioned is one of the oldest cocktails, and contains the basic template for almost _all_ cocktails - spirit, bitters, sugar, water. This drink is classically made with bourbon or rye, but any kind of whiskey will serve, and variants with other base spirits are viable (a rum or mezcal old fashioned can be quite good).

As with many cocktails and the martini, there's some flexibility on ratios here - more syrup results in a sweeter drink. I would be careful about adding more bitters as bitters have flavors of their own that will throw off the balance of the drink, but done carefully it can work.

I do not make or order this cocktail often. A very good old fashioned is a rare and excellent thing, but it's very easy to mess this one up. I've seen "old fashioneds" shaken and dumped into a glass, made with all kinds of inappropriate additions, made with poor quality whiskeys, made with too much sugar, too much bitters, or not stirred well, and any of these mistakes results in a drink that's much worse than just drinking whiskey neat or on the rocks.

Much like the martini, since this drink is primarily whiskey, use a good one. Other bitters options than Angostrura can be viable, but I like sticking to the tried and true path here. Using a demerara syrup instead of simple will improve the drink, and for some flair, one could use a flavored syrup. I like an old fashioned made with maple syrup in the fall.

This drink is pretty straightforward, and I don't make it too much, so I'll leave it here for today.
