## Corn 'n' Oil

The Corn 'n' Oil is named for the contrast between the colors of the ingredients and how they blend together - the darkness of blackstrap rum combined with the light velvet falernum and lime juice. This cocktail is pretty strong, where a balanced drink might be 2:1:1 liquor:citrus:sweetener, this one is 4:1:1. The flavor is delightfully Caribbean and plays on themes we see in the Daiquiri, Ti' Punch, and Caipirinha, but without tasting anything like those drinks.


### Ingredients

Blackstrap rum isn't a real rum category, according to any official source. Blackstrap rums are supposedly made with blackstrap molasses, but in reality that isn't quite true, and most 'blackstrap' rums are actually very young rums with molasses (blackstrap or not) added for coloring to make them appear aged. The actual quality of most blackstrap rums is close to many average white rums, but there is a distinct color and flavor profile here. I used Gosling Black Seal, which is okay.

Velvet Falernum is a sugar cane liqueur flavored with lime, ginger, almond, and clove, and makes an excellent pairing with rums. I used John D. Taylor's, which is an excellent Falernum.

### Preparation Notes

There are a variety of ways to prepare a Corn 'n' Oil, some of which involve layering. The drink is very customizable to personal flavor profiles. The spec here is fairly booze-forward, but you could change the proportions and get a solid drink that works with your palate.

Cheers!
