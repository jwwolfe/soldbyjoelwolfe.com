## Mai Tai

This is the first tiki cocktail on our list. Tiki has an entire history and culture behind it, but I tend to think of tiki drinks as being defined by having a split base of different types of the same base spirit. Traditionally, and here in the Mai Tai, the base spirit is rum, which makes sense because rum comes in many varieties and mixes well with other rums, as well as with the tropical flavors that often show up in tiki drinks.

### Ingredients

While recipes call for using a Jamaican rum (which is a good idea, I used Smith and Cross) and traditionally a Martinique rum, this is a good cocktail to experiment with and use different rums, and different ratios. I don't actually have real orange curacao, but Grand Marnier is close enough so I used it as a substitute, and the resulting drink is still pretty good. Orgeat is an almond syrup, and while I usually prepare my syrups at home, making orgeat is more work than even I am willing to do, so I buy premade bottles.

### Preparation Notes

No special preparation notes for this one, it can be served on crushed ice if you like.

Cheers!
