## Hurricane

This is technically another tiki drink, with the combination of rums. But the Hurricane is more well known for being something you buy in ridiculous plastic cups and drink in New Orleans. This one has a fun and known history - it was invented in the 1940s at Pat O’Brien’s in New Orleans, because there was a surplus of rum and people weren't ordering it, preferring more expensive whiskey and gin drinks (People in the 1940s: I see you, and I feel you).

This thing is SWEET. I will probably halve the syrup going into this for future iterations.

### Ingredients

I copped out and used a store-bought passionfruit syrup, which feels better than buying premade Hurricane mix. I also didn't use freshly squeezed oranges, as I don't have any on hand, which means I also had to substitute a mint leaf garnish. I'm not proud of myself, but my stores aren't in the best shape after a month of this project. Other than that, I think this is a drink where I wouldn't want to use higher quality rums - the rum gets completely overpowered by all the other ingredients, don't waste something good in this.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing special here, but note that this is a double strength drink and stay responsible.

Cheers!
