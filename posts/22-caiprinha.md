## Caiprinha

The caiprinha is the national cocktail of Brazil, which is made from a Brazilian liquor called cachaça that is very similar to rum, but earthier and . With the sugar and lime, this makes this drink similar to the daiquiri, but it's really a different experience, even though many of the key notes are the same. It's a good combination, also used in Ti' Punch.

### Ingredients

I have Ypioca Crystal Cachaça, and I don't really know how good it is, as I haven't had many other cachaças to compare with this one, but the drink is pretty good.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing special for this one, it's pretty easy.

Cheers!
