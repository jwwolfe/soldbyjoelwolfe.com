## Daiquiri

The daiquiri gets a bad rap - this drink is not the frozen fruit slushy that comes to mind when most people hear the drink's name. Not that there's anything wrong with a frozen daiquiri, but the daiquiri is an old and critical drink in the cocktail canon. The basic daiquiri formula - two parts liquor, one part sweetener, one part citrus, is the basic sour formula. Mastering this formula unlocks many many delicious drinks - but doing so requires adjusting the ratio as needed to maintain a balance between the boozy, sour, and sweet flavors. When the drink is perfectly balanced, a daiquiri is sublime.

Classically, the rum used in a daiquiri is is unaged white rum. Using a more aged rum results in a richer and more complex drink. Rum is a very varied and interesting liquor that can have many different flavor profiles depending on country of origin, distilling method, and age. When I get a new rum, a daiquiri is usually the second way I try it, after drinking some of it neat. I find that rums aged 3-5 years often make for excellent daiquiris, but rums aged longer than 5 years tend to be better neat or in stirred drinks.

For the lime juice, do not buy a bottle of presqueezed lime juice. Get fresh limes and a citrus press. It is worth it. I have read that lime juice is actually optimal 4-6 hours after squeezing, but I have yet to do an experiment on this. One other useful note here is if you can find key limes, they have a sharper and more sour flavor profile than the usual Persian limes, and I find that a 50/50 mixture of the two lime types often works better than either on its own.

A simple syrup made with regular white sugar and water (a 50/50 ratio by weight, mixed in a blender) works great in a daiquiri, but I find a better result with a syrup made from evaporated cane juice, which has a light brown color and retains some molasses flavor. I like this because I find it plays well with rum, which is a liquor made from molasses or other sugars.

Finally, notes on shaking: I prefer to use a tin on tin Boston shaker - I do not trust glass shakers, and the increased space in a Boston shaker over a cobbler shaker makes it easier to build a double when drinking with a friend. Typically when shaking a drink, fill the large tin with ice, then combine the ingredients from the cheapest to the most expensive in the smaller shaker. This ordering is done so that if you make a mistake when building the drink, you don't waste the expensive ingredients. When all ingredients are in place, put the smaller shaker into the larger, and hit the smaller shaker into the bottom to form a seal. If the seal has been made correctly, you should be able to pick up the entire combined shaker by grasping only the smaller shaker on top. Shake the drink using a consistent motion for around 30 seconds, then unseal (this may require some force, as the shakers will get colder during the process), and strain.
