## Clover Club

I mentioned this drink when I made the Pink Lady. As I predicted, this drink is much better. The lemon juice adds so much depth, it's exactly what the Pink Lady was missing. This drink feels complete, and I enjoyed it quite a lot.

This drink has a fun history of being consumed by gentlemen at a club, and many resources on it use it as an example of why a drink being pink doesn't make it a fruity sugar bomb for people who don't like cocktails. I think such distinctions are silly, this drink is beautiful and tastes great.

### Ingredients

I used Citadelle gin for this one. I also used fresh raspberries muddled into simple syrup instead of a premixed raspberry syrup, because there aren't many drinks that use raspberry syrup that would justify making a batch. Although it might be worth it just to make this.

### Preparation Notes

I tried a reverse dry shake, which is exactly what it sounds like - a dry shake where you shake with ice and no egg first, then strain out the ice and shake the cold drink with the egg white and no ice. It turned out just as good as a normal dry shake.

Cheers!
