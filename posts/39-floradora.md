## Floradora

This is a nice easy highball, not dissimilar from the Bramble, but different enough to include. It's almost much older - the supposed story for this one that it was made by a bartender named Jimmy Oâ€™Brien for one of the dancers in the stage show Florodora, who claimed to have tried all existing cocktails and wanted something brand new. I have no idea whether that story is true or not, or why the drink and the stage show are spelled differently, but the drink is pretty good, ginger, raspberry, and lime work really well with gin.

### Ingredients

Use a London dry gin here. I used Bombay Dry. I also typically use Fever Tree ginger beer, although whatever ginger beer you like works just as well.

### Preparation Notes

If you've made some ginger syrup because you're a discerning individual who likes mixing up a Penicillin, you can use club soda with ginger syrup instead of ginger beer. You can also use fresh raspberries muddled into syrup instead of simple syrup, but if you're doing that, I would shake the non-carbonated ingredients first. Given these different options there are a lot of ways to build this drink that all work. The exact amounts of each ingredient seem to vary quite a bit from recipe to recipe. This is a good drink to experiment with to learn how to balance flavors, since it has a lot adding sweetness.

Cheers!
