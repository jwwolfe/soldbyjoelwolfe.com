## Margarita

Ah, the margarita. I know I say this too much, but this is one of my favorite cocktails. It's probably the one I drink the most. At first glance it's just a tequila sour, but using orange liqueur for the sweetener adds a dimension, and the salt on the rim (which is optional, but come on) adds yet another.

### Ingredients

Okay, six ingredients. Most recipes for this drink omit the agave nectar and use a full ounce of orange liqueur, but the agave nectar adds depth and pulls agave flavors from the tequila in a way that I find irresistible.

This is a drink that I ALWAYS make with a 50/50 split of Persian lime and key lime juice. I once did an experiment where I made multiple margaritas, where the only difference was lime juice ratios. I tried one with only Persian lime, one with only key lime, one with 2/3rds Persian + 1/3rd key lime, one with 1/3rd Persian and 2/3rds key lime, and one half and half. The half and half was the clear winner, and I've never looked back. I recommend running experiments like this to optimize cocktail making.

For this margarita, I used Cimarron Reposado tequila. Margarita recipes usually call for blanco tequila, which is unaged, but I like reposados best, so that's what I use.

Margaritas also usually call for triple sec, or orange liqueur. Cointreau is just... much much better. Grand Marnier also works, either as a substitute or an addition.

### History

It's not that there's no known origin of the margarita, it's more that there are many conflicting origins of the margarita.

### Preparation Notes

Salting the rim is fun. I sometimes enjoy adding a pinch of salt to margarita before shaking.

Cheers!
