## Rickey

Thought it is similar to several drinks we've done before, like the Collins, the Paloma, and the Cuba Libre, the lack of sugar in the Ricky makes it stand apart. This is an elegant drink. If made with Tequila and Topo Chico, this is a Ranch Water, which is also delicious.

### Ingredients

I used Ki No Bi gin, which is excellent. Almost any gin will do, though. I used Rambler Sparkling Water, but any carbonated water works.

### Preparation Notes

For most drinks, precise measurements are very important. I don't think this is one of them.

Cheers!
