## Paloma

I realized that it's day 6 and I haven't posted a tequila drink. So our Labor Day drink is going to be Mexico's most popular tequila cocktail, the Paloma. The paloma could be considered a highball, as in its most simple form it only consists of tequila and grapefruit soda, but alternative specs for this drink go as far as using grapefruit juice, lime juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup with club soda to produce a similar effect. The paloma is versatile and delicious, as the grapefruit soda provides a sweet and bitter core with some sourness that is built on with the lime juice, and the salt rim adds a nice final touch of saltiness. With the bright agave flavor of tequila, the result is a tasty, balanced, effervescent drink that tastes amazing on a hot summer afternoon.

One thing I love about the paloma is that it's very easy to experiment with. As I mentioned above, there are many different ways to build a paloma, and none are wrong. You can use a salt rim, or even put salt directly into the drink, or not. If you choose to use grapefruit soda, there are many different brands and flavor profiles available that all have different sweetness and grapefruit flavor highlights. Adding lime or lemon juice to bring out more sour flavor in the drink is also entirely optional. You can accomodate any tequila with the right balance of flavors, or make it with mezcal. This drink works any way you make it, so make it according to what you like best!
