## Penicillin

I have said of many cocktails so far that they are "one of my favorites". The Penicillin is not one of my favorite cocktails, it's the number one. The Penicillin was invented by Sam Ross at Milk & Honey right after the turn of the 21st century, and quickly rode the cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s to become a modern classic. And it deserves to be. At first glance this is just a weird variant of the whiskey sour, but what's this? Two different kinds of scotch? In a shaken drink? And ginger and honey? All these innovations are brilliant and make the Penicillin a unique experience (aside from all the variants of it that have cropped up, of course). It's nothing like a typical whiskey sour - made without egg, a whiskey sour is fine, but it's a thin drink that doesn't have too much going on. The Penicillin has depth in every sip.

### Ingredients

I used Monkey Shoulder for my blended Scotch, and Highland Park 12 Year for my single malt. The syrups here are kind of interesting - I make them both myself. Honey syrup is a 1:1 mixture of honey and water, blended because pouring straight honey into a drink ends with a sticky shaker and not much honey in the drink. Ginger syrup is a little more complex, but it's not too hard to make in a food processor with some ginger root (I don't bother peeling it), sugar, and water. Once I've written up all 100 cocktails I might add some notes on syrups and techniques, and if I do that I will update this space with links to more involved recipes for the syrups.

In the past out of laziness I've used Drambuie, which is a honey scotch liqueur, to make this drink. It works okay.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing special here - make sure to shake and not stir.

Cheers!
