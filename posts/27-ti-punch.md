## Ti' Punch

The national drink of Martinique, this formula should be familiar as we've seen it in the daiquiri and the caipirinha - except this time we're using rhum agricole as our base. Rhum agricole is very similar to our cacha√ßa from the caipirinha - both are made from fermented sugarcane juice, where rums are made from fermented molasses. But the results in all three drinks are very different. A daiquiri is a bright sour, the caipirinha is a refreshing lowball, and ti' punch is more like a rum old fashioned.

This drink is typically served so that guests can mix their own according to their taste and preference.

### Ingredients

I used Rhum J.M. Agricole Blanc. Rhum agricole is very similar to rum, but it's very funky and vegetal. You can substitute it for rum in almost any rum cocktail, but results may vary.

### Preparation Notes

This one is easy and fun, just put the ingredients in a glass and drink up.

Cheers!
