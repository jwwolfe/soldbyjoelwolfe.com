## Whiskey Smash

The Whiskey Smash is closely related to the Mint Julep, which I have not covered yet, but will eventually. This adds only lemon, and isn't served in a julep cup, and it's also much more accessible, and easy to make. The addition of citrus elevates the drink and turns the boozy julep into a refreshing sour concotion.

### Ingredients

I used Larceny Bourbon in this Whiskey Smash. You could make it with many whiskeys. I like a good bourbon, rye, or Irish.

In this recipe, I call for the use of plain white granulated sugar instead of the usual simple syrup. This isn't a requirement, you could use simple syrup here, but the muddling process and the amount of crushed ice used here are enough dilution, so I go for the direct sweetener.

### History

This drink dates to the 1800s, and both Jerry Thomas and Harry Johnson wrote about juleps with fruit included, although it was Johnson who called it a "smash" specifically.

### Preparation Notes

There are many ways to make a whiskey smash, and none of them are wrong. You can use whatever fruit you want, or even multiple fruits, simple syrup instead of sugar, different sugars, and using crushed ice or ice cubes are both valid. This one is good to experiment with and have fun, it's really hard to mess it up. I think lemon works better with whiskey than lime, but I like adding either blackberry or strawberry sometimes when I make this drink, as both play well with lemon and whiskey and mint.

I forgot to include notes on mint bouquet garnishes in earlier drinks that have used them. The ends of spearmint plants work best for garnishes, and there are a couple of tricks to really making them pop. First, while you're preparing the drink, fill a small glass with ice water, and place the mint bouquet upside down in the ice water. When the drink is ready to be garnished, pull it out, shake off the water into a sink, and place the bouquet in the palm of one hand, and slap it. The ice water helps the mint look its best, and slapping it releases fragrance.

Cheers!
