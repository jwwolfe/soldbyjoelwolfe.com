## Last Word

Another day, another gin cocktail. I've been trying to mix up the liquors used, but the reality is by the end, this list is going to skew hard towards gin and rum - there are just more cocktails made with both, because they're more versatile. And the Last Word features gin in an equal parts mixture with Green Chartreuse, marachino liqueur, and lime juice.

For a shaken cocktail, the Last Word really packs a punch. Chartreuse clocks in at 55% ABV, so combined with the gin (usually at 40% ABV) this drink is *stiff*. The flavor packs as much punch as the alcohol, though. Green Chartreuse is a spirit made by monks in france from over 130 alpine herbs in a secret recipe, and here those flavors combine with the gin, the lime, and the surprising richness of maraschino liqueur to make a complex, pungent potion.

For the gin, I used Bluecoat American Gin, which works nicely, but other American gins or a London Dry are also good, and have a surprisingly powerful effect on the resulting cocktail. There are no substitutes or offbrands for Green Chartreuse. I use Luxardo maraschino liqueur and strongly recommend it. As always, use freezly squeezed lime juice.

Cheers!
