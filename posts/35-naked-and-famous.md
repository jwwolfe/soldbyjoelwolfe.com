## Naked and Famous

The Naked and Famous is an equal parts cocktail that is actually a variant of the Last Word. It's another modern classic, invented at Death & Co in New York City (incidentally, Death & Co have an excellent book that taught me many useful things about making cocktails). Despite being a "Last Word variant", this drink is not really that similar as far as flavor goes. The similarity is in the proportions and the way the ingredients work together to create something unique. This drink is delicious.

### Ingredients

Somehow we made it to number 35 before introducing mezcal. Technically, that's not true, as tequila is a subset of mezcal, but the divide between the bright, agave forward tequila, and smoky, complex mezcal has enough clarity to think of them as separate ingredients.

### Preparation Notes

Shake, strain, serve. Equal parts shaken cocktails are very easy.


Cheers!
