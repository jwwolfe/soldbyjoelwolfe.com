## Bijou

Another equal parts gin cocktail. On the surface, this looks a lot like a negroni, but swapping the bitter Campari for the complex and fragrant Green Chartreuse makes for a *very* different drink. I wouldn't even call this a variant - in both of these drinks I would not consider gin the primary ingredient - Campari leads in a Negroni, and the Chartreuse leads here.

### Ingredients

For this bijou, I used Plymouth gin and Carpano Antica vermouth. I think it's pretty excellent, although other gins would certainly work here. Green Chartreuse has no substitute.

### History

The Bijou was invented sometime in the late 19th century by Harry Johnson. He named it "Bijou", which means "jewel", for the ingredients: diamond for gin, emerald for chartreuse, and ruby for the sweet vermouth.


### Preparation Notes

This one is pretty straightforward, just pour equal amounts of each ingredient, add a dash of orange bitters, stir with ice, and strain.

Cheers!
