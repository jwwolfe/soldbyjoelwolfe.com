## Paper Plane

The Paper Plane is a variation of the Last Word, created by Sasha Petraske and Sam Ross of Milk & Honey. This is a fun variation, because it tastes nothing like a Last Word at all, but it follows the same 4 ingredient template, and has some similar qualities. However, the actual flavor profile is more bitter forward.

### Ingredients

Amaro Nonino Quintessentia is new to us here, it's an Italian amaro, like Aperol or Campari. We also use Aperol here, although the original recipe apparently called for Campari (note to self: try that sometime). For the bourbon, I used Michter's, which is excellent. As always, use freshly squeezed lemon juice.

### Preparation Notes

The only hard part here is making a paper airplane that small that doesn't look terrible.

Cheers!
