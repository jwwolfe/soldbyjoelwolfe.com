 - Recipe
 - 2oz gin or whiskey or tequila
 - 1oz lemon
 - .5oz simple syrup
 - soda water
 - lemon wheel

 Directions: Fill a highball glass with ice cubes, then add the liquor, simple syrup, and lemon juice. Top with soda water, stir gently, and garnish with the lemon wheel.

## Collins

If you cross a sour and a highball, you get a Collins. It uses a familiar pattern for sour drinks and tops it with carbonated water, making for a refreshing summer drink. Like sours, mixing and matching liquors and citrus fruits makes a 'close enough' variant which may or may not have its own name. Tom Collins is the most popular, made with gin.

I like this drink, but I don't make it much.

### Ingredients

For my Tom Collins, I used Roku gin, fresh lemon juice, and Topo Chico, but honestly this drink works fine with just about anything for the liquor. It's obviously better with higher quality liquor, but if fizzy alcoholic lemonade is your thing, this will take almost any liquor far.

### History

This is a very old drink with dubious origins. People were arguing in the late 1800s about whether it was invented in America or England. Also apparently it was originally called a John Collins, but the name changed, and now some people call it a "John Collins" if you use whiskey. Cocktail history is weird.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing special here. If you want to go wild, a fun experiment could be to try shaking before adding the soda water and see if there's any texture or flavor profile change.

Cheers!
