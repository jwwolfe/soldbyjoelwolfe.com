## White Russian

It's a special day when I post a vodka drink. The White Russian isn't one of my favorite cocktails, but if a creamy coffee flavored beverage with alcohol sounds good, this is the drink. This one seems to be pretty recently invented, first appearing in the 1960s, but it's not clear who invented it.

### Ingredients

I used Tito's vodka, whole milk, and, uh, a homemade coffee liqueur. You can use pretty much any vodka in this, because almost all vodkas are the same thing. The coffee liqueur matters a whole lot more, but any coffee liqueur you like will work fine here.

### Preparation Notes

There are various fancy things you can do with the cream topper, such as shaking it beforehand, or using ice cream instead. Other than that, it's pretty easy to make.

Cheers!
