## Jungle Bird

This is another Tiki drink, although it only uses one type of rum, the lime and pineapple and the split base with Campari makes it qualify. This drink is an unusual and excellent use of Campari, and the resulting drink is both sweet and bitter in equal measures. I was first recommended this drink after I'd ordered one too many Negronis at a cocktail bar, and the bartenders thought this would be a good branch-out drink for me. They were completely correct, this drink is complex, funky, bitter, sweet, and always excellent.

### Ingredients

I used Smith & Cross Jamaican rum, which works excellently in this drink. I don't fuck with trying to juice fresh pineapples, so I use store-bought pineapple juice. I'm sure fresh would be better.

As I don't stock pineapple, I didn't have a pineapple wedge to use for the garnish, and so I used a mint bouquet instead. It looks fine but not as lavish as I've seen this drink served before. Edible flowers would also make a fun garnish here.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing too special that hasn't been covered before.

Cheers!
