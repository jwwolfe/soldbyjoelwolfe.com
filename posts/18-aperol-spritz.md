## Aperol Spritz

This is the first time I've ever made this drink. I love Aperol, but I'm not a big champagne fan. The result is okay, not my favorite thing, but it's a nice low alcohol sipper. The only oranges I have right now are blood oranges, which I think looks pretty cool

### Ingredients

Aperol is a bitter liqueur like Campari, but with a different flavor profile. Spritzes usually call for Prosseco for the champagne. I used some random Prosecco I bought, I don't know anything about wine, really.

### History

Old. Italy. Exact origins unknown.

### Preparation Notes

This one is self explanatory.

Cheers!
