## Bramble

The Bramble is a newer cocktail, so its origins are less murky than some of the classics. This drink was invented in London in the 1980s by Dick Bradsell. It's a variation on a gin sour that adds blackberry liqueur and blackberries as part of the sweetener.

A London Dry gin is perfect for this drink. As always, use freshly squeezed lemon juice, and fresh blackberries. Creme de mure is the fancy name for blackberry liqueur. If you don't have creme de mure, you can simulate the effect by using .25oz of each gin and simple syrup and add some more blackberries muddled into it.

This drink looks really cool and tastes fantastic. It's refreshing and juicy, and the blackberry pieces mixed into the light yellow of the gin and lemon base is simply lovely.

These posts have been a little bit lighter as I've been doing some simple (and delicious) drinks, so I thought I would take the time today, at the beginning of week two, to make a more involved drink that introduces some new techniques. This drink has some extra steps that I haven't touched on yet - short shaking, muddling, and crushed ice.

*Short shaking* just means shaking with a small amount of ice, usually 3 ice cubes. We will return to this technique when we get into egg cocktails. In this drink it's not necessary, but the crushed ice will dilute the drink due to the increased surface area of the drink touching ice, so we don't want to dilute it more during the shaking process.

*Muddling* is a technique for breaking down solid elements, usually fruits, into the bottom of a glass or shaker. Using a *muddler*, gentle tamp down on the fruit (in this case blackberries) until it's broken down. The most common mistake with muddling is smashing the muddler, a gentle but firm press is all that is needed.

*Crushed ice* is pretty easy to get these days, many refrigerators will produce it on demand. I do not have these modern conveniences, so I use a wooden mallet and a Lewis bag to crush the ice, which is pretty fun.
