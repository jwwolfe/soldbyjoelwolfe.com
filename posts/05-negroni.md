## Negroni

The negroni is one of my favorite cocktails. It is very simple to make, as it is three equal parts stirred. But the result is a truly sublime drink that works perfectly as an apéritif. I'll admit it isn't for everyone, as the Campari makes for a very bitter experience, but for anyone who enjoys bitterness, I recommend giving this one a try.

This negroni was made with Beefeater London Dry gin and Carpano Antica vermouth. Campari cannot be substituted in this cocktail, but other good gins will work, and other sweet vermouths (again, not Martini & Rossi) will also do fine. Campari is the star of the show here, but a gin that can stand up to its flavor is going to make a better drink.

The negroni is a simple classic, and many people's first introduction to Campari, which is our first liqueur and first bitters to show up on this blog. Liqueurs tend to be more specific and specialized than liquors as ingredients, and Campari definitely fits that bill. It's an intensely bitter ingredient whose red coloring is distinctive (but added for branding, not a result of the ingredients that impart flavor), but has notes of sweetness, fruit, and spices.

There are many good variations on the negroni, such as the White Negroni, which substitutes the Campari and vermouth for Lillet Blanc and Suze, and the Boulevardier, which substitutes the negroni's gin for rye whiskey.
