## Aviation

This blog would not exist if not for the Aviation. The first time I had this drink, it was a revelation. The first sip made me realize that making drinks can be more than just a way to make alcohol taste better, they can be an entire experience and work of art in themselves. This isn't my favorite cocktail ever, but it's very high up on the list. The pale bluish-purple color leads one to expect something unusual, and the Aviation rewards by being a floral sour with a pungent hint of cherry.

### Ingredients

I almost always use Plymouth gin in an Aviation, but for this one I tried using Nikka Coffey Gin, which turned out quite nice. Rothman and Winter make an excellent creme de violette. The creme de violette can also be substituted with Creme Yvette, but you might want to hold back and tweak, it's a different flavor profile. I use Luxardo for my maraschino liqueur.

### Preparation Notes

It took me a very long time to learn to make an Aviation correctly, and a big part of the reason for that is most recipes out there are very bad. The Aviation had a rough history and for a long time, creme de violette wasn't commonly available and this drink either wasn't made, or was made without it. This is a bad idea. But most recipes call for way too much maraschino liqueur, and not enough creme de violette - using too much creme de violette makes the drink extra floral and a little sweeter, but too much maraschino overpowers the gin and lemon. I've settled on using a full half ounce of creme de violette for a nice floral and purple drink, with only a teaspoon of maraschino, and some simple syrup to even things up with the lemon's sourness, but more or less creme de violette or simple syrup have worked for me, just depending on how sweet and floral you want the drink to come out.

Other than that, it's just a shaken drink and easy enough to prepare.

Cheers!
