## Martini

The Martini is one of the true joys of the cocktail world. It is perhaps the most well known of all classic cocktails, to the point that the "martini glass" is a universal symbol of cocktails in general. Despite being a very simple drink that is mostly gin (or vodka, more on that in a moment), the martini is surprisingly complex. As will be the case with every post in this series, the recipe I've listed above is my personal preference - I like an extra dry martini with a lemon twist.

Martinis change a surprising amount with small differences in the amount of vermouth included, and the garnish. The orange bitters are also optional, I like the additional flair they add. Winston Churchill once remarked that the correct amount of vermouth in a martini is "a glance at the vermouth bottle", and I almost agree with him, but I think a small amount of vermouth is still necessary. If you don't want the gin punching you in the face so much, you can increase the vermouth, a "balanced" martini would use half an ounce, and one could go up to .75 oz of vermouth (or more?) and you're still drinking a martini. Splitting the vermouth and using both dry and sweet vermouth results in a "Perfect Martini".

As for garnishes, I prefer the lemon twist, but an olive is equally viable. I also enjoy using a cocktail onion, at which point the Martini becomes a variant called a Gibson, in the only case I know of where changing only the garnish results in a variation on the drink. But it's still a gin and vermouth mixture. A "Dirty" Martini includes olive juice, which I think is a _completely_ different drink, but it still counts as a martini, and if you love olives or hate gin it's fair game.

Some notes on the instructions above: I prefer the Nick and Nora glass for the martini and other stirred drinks, but a martini glass is obviously the classic choice. The reason for adding the ice water while you make the drink is to chill the glass so the martini stays cold longer. When adding ice to your mixing glass, use A LOT of ice. You want this drink to be _cold_, and while it will dilute some in the stirring, that is expected. If you want a stronger drink you could stir for less time and start with chilled gin and vermouth. Finally, "expressing" the lemon peel means twisting it over the top of the drink, then rubbing the peel on the rim of the glass to impart some lemon oils.

For this drink, unlike the highball, I don't think you can get away with cheap ingredients. Using bottom shelf gin or vermouth will result in a bad martini. Especially the gin needs to be very good - luckily good gins are not expensive. I think you can make a solid martini with almost any type of gin, but this drink will shine most with a good London Dry. Many American Gins will also serve well in this drink. I would recommend a solid London Dry such as Beefeater or Bombay Dry. Plymouth Gin also makes an excellent martini. For the vermouth, avoid Martini & Rossi at all costs. Dolin Dry or Dolin White make for an excellent martini with a solid gin, and if you want to upgrade the vermouth beyond that, the results will only get better.

A Note on Vodka Martinis: I don't understand vodka cocktails. Most vodkas are built to taste like nothing at all, and while there are exceptional potato vodkas that do have flavor, this drink is just better with gin. Gin is the most versatile and interesting spirit and vodka martinis, in my opinion, are just wrong. If vodka is your thing and you love a vodka martini, you do you, but I cannot understand your life choices.
