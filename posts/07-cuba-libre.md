## Cuba Libre

After yesterday's paloma post I felt obliged to include this drink, which is very similar. At first glance this is just a rum and coke, and wait, didn't I promise not to do highball variations? I did, but I think the addition of lime juice makes this more nuanced than a simple rum and coke. For this one, I split the rum base between Probitas white rum and aged Puerto Rican Havana Club (we will get more into splitting rum bases as I tackle tiki drinks), and used a Fever Tree cola. The addition of lime here really heightens and balances the drink.

There is not too much else to say on preparation here.

The drink supposedly originated during the Spanish-American War when Coca-Cola was first shipped to Cuba, mixed with Cuban rum and lime instead of an older version of the Cuba Libre that was made with molasses or honey syrup bases. Many older cocktails have multiple or dubious (or multiple dubious) origin stories, so I don't go in too much for the cocktail historian role. Unfortunately it is still not so simple to get Cuban rums stateside, so making a true Cuba Libre with Cuban rum is out of reach.

We've made it through the first week of cocktails!
