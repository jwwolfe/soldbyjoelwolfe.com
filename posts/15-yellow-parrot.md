## Yellow Parrot

This is another three equal parts cocktail. It has really striking fruity, herbal flavor, and a silky smooth texture. It's a really unexpected drink and I think it's really underrated.

### Ingredients

I managed to pick a cocktail made entirely with ingredients I haven't written about yet!

Absinthe is an anise flavored spirit. For this I used St. George Absinthe Verte.

Yellow Chartreuse is the counterpart to Green Chartreuse, made by the same French monks. The yellow version is sweeter than the green, and has a different herbal profile. Like Green Chartreuse this is unique and has no substitutes.

Apricot liqueur is self explanatory. I used Rothman & Winter Orchard Apricot in this drink.

### History

This is another cocktail that has mostly unknown origins. I've seen several sources that say the first appearance in print was in a book by Robert Vermeire in 1922, but whether he invented it or recorded an existing cocktail is unknown.

### Preparation Notes

The key to this drink is dilution. When mixed with water, absinthe forms what's known as a louche, which means that parts of the absinthe come out of solution and make the absinthe whiter and cloudier, which also changes the texture and flavor. We aren't going to the extremes that some absinthe preparations go here, but it's still key to making this drink work. Some recipes call for shaking, which is another way to get a lot of dilution, but I think this works better stirred.

Dilution is also why we mix with ice for extra time and then ALSO put the drink in more ice cubes.

Cheers!
