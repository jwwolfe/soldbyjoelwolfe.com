## Water Lily

Yet another equal parts cocktail! There's something special about equal parts cocktails. This one is a delightful drink that I think of as a variation on the Aviation, because of the gin, lemon, and creme de violette. I don't think it's actually a variation, but I can't find any information on the history of this drink. Regardless, it has a similar spec and flavor, but the orange instead of marachino is a fun twist.

### Ingredients

I used Bombay Sapphire for the gin here, and Cointreau for the orange liqueur.

### Preparation Notes

Nothing special here.

Cheers!
