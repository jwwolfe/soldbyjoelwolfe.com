I am a software engineer based out of Austin, Texas who enjoys making and drinking cocktails. My home bar has over 100 different bottles of liquors and liqueurs.

Why I am doing this? Other than the obvious reasons of "boredom" and "because I felt like it", which should be sufficient, I wanted to challenge myself. Coming up with a list of 100 different cocktails was actually quite a bit more difficult than I thought it would be, and there are a ton of drinks on the list that I've never made before. Consistently building drinks and writing about them will either make me much better at this or make me hate it, and either should be interesting.
